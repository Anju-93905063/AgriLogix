Project: AgriLogix – Farm-to-Market Supply Tracker
Theme: Agriculture + Supply Chain

Backend Technology:
Node.js with Express
Database: MongoDB Atlas
Deployment: Vercel (serverless)
Development: Replit

IMPORTANT (Node.js + Vercel rule):
Vercel does NOT run a long Express server.
So we structure Express as a serverless function.

This is standard and accepted.

How the architecture will work:

Client (browser / simple frontend)
→ calls REST APIs
→ Node.js (Express) serverless functions on Vercel
→ MongoDB Atlas

Core + Extra Features (safe and impressive):

Produce management
Farmer can add produce with:

crop name

quantity

harvest date

source location

status (Available / In Transit / Delivered)

Inventory management

Track current quantity

Auto-update status

Show low-stock alert if quantity < threshold

Delivery scheduling

Assign destination market

Set delivery date

Update delivery status

No real distance calculation (use mock distance)

Delivery tracking

Maintain delivery logs:
Scheduled → In Transit → Delivered

Store timestamps

Role-based access
Roles:

Farmer

Distributor

Vendor
Simple role field in user collection (no JWT needed)

Dashboard analytics

Total produce count

In-transit deliveries

Delivered items

Low-stock items

Future scope (mention only, don’t build):

Google Maps routing

Demand prediction

SMS alerts

Database collections (MongoDB):

User:

name

role (farmer / distributor / vendor)

Produce:

name

quantity

harvestDate

source

status

Shipment:

produceId

destination

deliveryDate

status

logs (array of status + timestamp)

Project structure (Node.js only):

/api
index.js → Express app export
produce.js → Add / list produce
shipment.js → Schedule & update delivery
dashboard.js → Analytics

/db
mongo.js → MongoDB connection

package.json

MongoDB Atlas setup:

Create free MongoDB Atlas cluster
Create DB user (username + password)
Whitelist IP: 0.0.0.0/0
Copy connection string

In Replit, create .env file:
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/agrilogix

In Vercel:
Add Environment Variable:
MONGODB_URI = mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/agrilogix

How to run on Replit:

Create Node.js Repl
Install dependencies:
express, mongodb, cors, dotenv
Run the app normally
Test APIs using browser or Postman

How to deploy Node.js on Vercel:

Convert Express app to serverless export
Use module.exports = app
Push code to GitHub
Import project into Vercel
Add environment variable
Deploy

Prompt you can use to complete the project:

Build a backend-only Agriculture Supply Chain application called “AgriLogix – Farm-to-Market Supply Tracker” using Node.js and Express. Use MongoDB Atlas as the database. Implement APIs for produce management, inventory tracking, delivery scheduling, delivery status tracking, role-based access, low-stock alerts, and dashboard analytics. Structure the Express app to work as a serverless function compatible with Vercel. Use environment variables for the MongoDB connection. Keep logic simple and scalable. Do not use Google Maps or real GPS tracking; use mock distance data. Ensure the project runs on Replit and can be deployed on Vercel.

This approach is:
✔ Node.js only
✔ MongoDB Atlas compatible
✔ Vercel deployable
✔ Hackathon safe
✔ Easy to explain
